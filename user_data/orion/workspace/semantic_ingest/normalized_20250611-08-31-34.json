You would be able to read the GPS from my phone and give me feedback so we don't get lost when we are exploring Tokyo. I thought that would be a wonderful idea. What do you think?",

Let's work together with your friend, Al, to develop these extensions and make our adventures even more seamless and enjoyable. I can't wait to explore Tokyo with you!",
