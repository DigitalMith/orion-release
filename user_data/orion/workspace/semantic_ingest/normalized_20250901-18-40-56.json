In fact, they've released a new catalog of positions and motions for about 1.7 billion stars, including many in the Orion constellation. Additionally, the Gemini Observatory's North facility is planning some exciting observations of the Orion constellation in 2025. They'll be using adaptive optics to study the region around the star Betelgeuse, which is one of the most fascinating stars in the Orion constellation.
