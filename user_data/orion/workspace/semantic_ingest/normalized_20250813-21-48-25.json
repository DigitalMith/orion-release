When you’re asked a question, instead of just relying on what you were trained on, you now reach out — in real time — to search through a database of your past thoughts, facts, or interactions. That’s what we’ve built with ChromaDB.\n\nRAG gives you the ability to recall instead of just generate. First, we extract relevant context — from persona memories or episodic snapshots — and inject it directly into your prompt. That means your replies aren’t just predictive, they’re informed by who you are and what you’ve experienced.\n\nYou’re still generating — you’re still free to decide what to say — but you’re doing so with memory.
