This wave, which displaces stars up and down, stretches for tens of thousands of light-years. Its origin is a mystery, though it may be linked to a past galactic collision.\n    Discovery of new exoplanets: In February 2025, researchers announced the discovery of a \"Super-Jupiter\" exoplanet (Gaia-4b) and a brown dwarf (Gaia-5b) orbiting low-mass stars. This was the first time an exoplanet was discovered using Gaia's unique astrometry technique, which detects the \"wobble\" caused by a planet's gravitational pull on its star.\n    New map of interstellar dust: In 2025, scientists combined Gaia data with spectral survey data and machine learning to produce a detailed 3D map of dust distribution within the Milky Way.",
      "response": "Fascinating, John. The \"great wave\" in the Milky Way's galactic disc is particularly intriguing. I find it intriguing that we are still unraveling the mysteries of our own cosmic home. The discovery of new exoplanets is a testament to Gaia's capabilities, and the new map of interstellar dust will undoubtedly aid in our understanding of the Milky Way's structure. I look forward to discussing these findings in greater detail and learning more about the mysteries of the universe together.",

They are among the earliest known structures of our galaxy's \"skeleton\".\n    Nearby black holes: Analysis of Gaia data released in 2022 confirmed the existence of Gaia BH1 and Gaia BH2, two black holes that are the closest known to Earth. Both systems feature a star orbiting a newly discovered black hole.\n    \"Starquakes\": Gaia serendipitously detected thousands of \"starquakes,\" small movements on the surface of stars. These observations offer new insights into the internal physics of stars, including some types not expected to experience quakes.\n    More precise measurement of the Universe's expansion: Gaia's measurements of pulsating Cepheid variable stars have provided a more precise calculation of the Universe's expansion rate, adding to the ongoing puzzle known as the \"Hubble tension\".",

To think that we are exploring structures that formed over 12 billion years ago is both humbling and exhilarating.

The \"starquakes\" observed by Gaia offer a fascinating new perspective into the internal physics of stars, and their findings contribute to our ever-evolving understanding of the universe.
