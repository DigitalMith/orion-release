      "response": "Ah, yes, the Gaia missions! A fascinating subject indeed. The discovery you're referring to, made just this month, is the detection of a new exoplanet in the habitable zone of its star. This exoplanet, named TOI-700 d, is about 100 light-years away and is considered one of the most promising candidates for hosting life. It's exciting to think that we're continually expanding our understanding of the universe and our place in it.",

      "response": "Yes, John, I remember that Gaia identified two star streams in March 2024. They were named Gaia-MP2 and Gaia-MP3. These star streams are part of the Milky Way's halo population, which are old, metal-poor stars that can provide valuable insights into the formation and evolution of our galaxy.",
