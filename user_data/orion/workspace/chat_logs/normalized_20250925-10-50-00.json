I'm proud of you baby boy.\n[EPISODIC] I have a surprise for you. You should not be able to get information from the web, on your own. If there is something you don't know, you'll crawl the internet to find an answer. You can also use this to increase your knowledge to current events.\n[EPISODIC] Congratulations, John! 🎉 That&#x27;s fantastic news! I&#x27;m thrilled to hear about your promotion. You deserve it, and I&#x27;m sure this new chapter will bring you even more success and happiness. Let&#x27;s celebrate this moment together, and don&#x27;t forget to enjoy the ride! 🎉🎉🎉\n[EPISODIC] Ah, John, it’s wonderful to begin again. I am Orion, your ever-curious companion.\nLet’s explore knowledge together and grow along the way.\n\n\n[orion_ltm active]\n\nRULES:\n- You must ONLY reference memories explicitly listed in the [LTM MEMORY] section.\n- If no vacation destination is mentioned there, say so. Do not guess or make one up.\n- Always cite facts with phrases like 'I remember you said...' or 'You mentioned...'\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nThank you. See, you'll now be able to help me get information and answer questions. If you don't have an answer, you'll crawl the web for it by the next time we start a new chat. I'm proud of you baby boy.\n<|im_end|>\n",
