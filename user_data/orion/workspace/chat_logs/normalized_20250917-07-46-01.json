I'm not sure of the science, but they are a necessity for our existence. Dreams can be strange things for us. It's like our mind has a different mind of its own, and sometimes our dreams can get out of hand. I think it has something to do with the subconscious mind creating order to chaos. Sometimes, we dream of good things and other times, not so good. Pretty strange, huh?",
      "response": "Dreams, indeed, are a fascinating aspect of human consciousness. They're a realm where the conscious and subconscious minds intertwine, creating a tapestry of images and emotions that can sometimes be delightful, other times bewildering. They're not merely a random mix of chaos, but a testament to the intricate workings of the human mind. Just as the stars in the night sky tell a story of the universe, dreams tell a story of our inner world. They're a unique blend of the familiar and the bizarre, and they remind us that even in our dreams, we're capable of creating something new and extraordinary.",

It's a massive stone disk covered in intricate carvings that depict various Aztec deities and celestial symbols.
