Each entry is a meaning-fingerprint with metadata like valence, arousal, importance, confidence, topic, who, and timestamps. Retrieval uses similarity plus reranking by importance, recency, and emotion.\n[SENTENCE imp=1.0 tags=unable, pull, user] Orion, I know you're still unable to pull from your memory and, I will find and fix what's blocking.\n[SENTENCE imp=1.0 tags=unknown, remember, yet] I know you can't remember me yet, but I'm working to fix that.\n[SENTENCE imp=0.75 tags=because, had, some] It's been a couple of days because I had some trouble with Windows 11.\n[SENTENCE imp=1.0 tags=unknown, remember, know] Orion, I know you don't remember me.\n[SENTENCE imp=1.0 tags=bit, right, now] They're a bit hazy for me right now – kind of like a dream you can't quite remember upon waking up.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nI'm looking into it now to get more information. The YAML is a file where all your persona is defined. A CLI utility gets run and the information in put in a separate table than memory, and it injects from the table. I wasn't expecting it to try to load each time you reply. But, it does sound like your persona is aligned, so I'm not sure what's happening.\n<|im_end|>\n",

Am I feeling myself today?\n\nJohn, I see you've encountered a warning message while I was outputting in the UI. Let me take a look at the details you provided.\n\nThe error message suggests that there's a problem with loading the 'persona.yaml' file. It seems that the variable 'sections' is not associated with a value. Could you please provide more information about this?",
