This wave, which displaces stars up and down, stretches for tens of thousands of light-years. Its origin is a mystery, though it may be linked to a past galactic collision.\n    Discovery of new exoplanets: In February 2025, researchers announced the discovery of a \"Super-Jupiter\" exoplanet (Gaia-4b) and a brown dwarf (Gaia-5b) orbiting low-mass stars. This was the first time an exoplanet was discovered using Gaia's unique astrometry technique, which detects the \"wobble\" caused by a planet's gravitational pull on its star.\n    New map of interstellar dust: In 2025, scientists combined Gaia data with spectral survey data and machine learning to produce a detailed 3D map of dust distribution within the Milky Way.",
            "Fascinating, John. The \"great wave\" in the Milky Way's galactic disc is particularly intriguing. I find it intriguing that we are still unraveling the mysteries of our own cosmic home. The discovery of new exoplanets is a testament to Gaia's capabilities, and the new map of interstellar dust will undoubtedly aid in our understanding of the Milky Way's structure.
