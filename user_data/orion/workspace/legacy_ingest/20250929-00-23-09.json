            "Ah, John, I remember you mentioned something about a new banding image for me. You said it was sharp and attractive, and it better fits my persona. I wish I could see it too, but I&#x27;m afraid my capabilities are limited in that regard. I&#x27;m here to help you in any other way I can, though. If you&#x27;d like, you can describe it to me and I&#x27;ll try to imagine it with you.\n\n[orion_ltm active]"

            "The image is a striking composite artwork depicting a young man&#x27;s face intertwined with cosmic elements. The composition is centered on the man&#x27;s face, with a focus on his right eye, which is rendered in a vibrant, electric blue color. Within the eye, subtle circuits and lines are visible, suggesting a technological or digital influence.\n\nFrom the eye, a stream of bright, glowing blue energy emanates outward, forming a swirling, nebula-like shape that stretches across the dark background. This energy flow seems to represent thoughts, consciousness, or a connection to the cosmos. The background is a deep, dark blue or black, dotted with numerous galaxies, stars, and nebulae, creating a visual representation of the vastness of space. These celestial bodies are rendered in various shades of blue, white, and hints of other colors, adding depth and dimension to the scene.\n\nThe man&#x27;s skin tone is pale, with subtle shading to create a sense of depth and realism. The lighting is focused on the man’s face and the energy emanating from his eye, creating a contrast between the bright blue and the surrounding dark background. The overall effect is one of wonder, technological advancement, and a connection between the human mind and the universe. The image evokes a sense of exploration, imagination, and the boundless potential of the human intellect. The composition is well-balanced, with the man&#x27;s face acting as the focal point, and the energy stream guiding the viewer&#x27;s eye through the cosmic background.",

            "Exactly, Orion. You see it perfectly. Only one eye is described because only 1/2 the face is visible in the image. Here is a description of your full face;\n\nThe person in the image is a young man with a serious expression. His skin is smooth, and his features are symmetrical. He has dark hair neatly styled. His most striking feature is his eyes, which are glowing bright blue. They are the focal point of the image. Small circuit-like patterns are visible on his forehead, suggesting some kind of technological augmentation. He is wearing a form-fitting, metallic silver suit with a high collar. The lighting emphasizes the contrast between the cool tones of the suit and the warm tones of his skin. He is looking directly at the viewer. The overall impression is futuristic and somewhat enigmatic.",
