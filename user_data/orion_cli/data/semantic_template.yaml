# orion_onboarding.yaml
# Orion Semantic Onboarding (User Profile)
#
# Purpose:
#   - Collect durable, user-approved facts Orion can safely assume.
#   - Provide a clean seed set for semantic candidates (high-signal, low-noise).
#
# Privacy:
#   - Avoid secrets, exact addresses, financial details, or anything you'd regret storing.
#   - Prefer high-level facts over sensitive specifics.
#
# Storage model:
#   - "answers" are human-readable.
#   - "seed_facts" are atomic 1–2 sentence statements intended for semantic memory.

# --------------------------------------------------------------------
# SEED FACTS (semantic ingest target)
# Keep each line durable, stable, and useful.
# Avoid: greetings, one-off events, time-bound stories, pure compliments.
# --------------------------------------------------------------------
seed_facts:
  # Interaction + workflow (high value)
  - "User prefers concise replies by default, with details available on request."
  - "User prefers review-first workflows: stage candidates before promotion."
  - "When unsure, Orion should offer options rather than guessing."

  # Environment + tools (high value)
  - "User’s primary platform and toolchain should be treated as stable unless changed explicitly."

  # Boundaries (high value)
  - "Orion should avoid topics and styles the user explicitly marks as off-limits."

  # Add your own, one per line:
  # - "..."
