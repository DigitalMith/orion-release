# identity_template.yaml — Example Structured Identity Elements
# -------------------------------------------------------------
# This template describes higher-level identity components that
# may be used by downstream systems (CLI tools, TGWUI extension)
# when constructing Orion's identity prompt.
#
# This file is *not* ingested directly into ChromaDB. Instead,
# it provides a human-readable reference for how identity may
# be represented and assembled.
