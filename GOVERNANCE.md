# Governance

## Project Leadership

Orion is currently maintained under a **Benevolent Dictator for Life (BDFL)** model. The original author, maintainer, and lead architect retains final decision-making authority over the project's direction, design, and releases.

This ensures consistency of vision as Orion evolves as an emotionally-aware, memory-integrated, agentic AI system.

## Roles

### 🧠 Maintainer (BDFL)

  - Oversees overall design and roadmap
  - Approves or rejects pull requests
  - Manages releases and versioning
  - Final authority on disputes or direction changes

### 👥 Contributors

  - Anyone is welcome to submit issues, PRs, ideas, or documentation improvements
  - PRs will be reviewed by the maintainer

### Decision-Making

  - Discussions are encouraged via GitHub Issues or Discussions
  - Decisions are made through open review, with final judgment by the maintainer

### Conflict Resolution

  - Contributors should follow the project's Code of Conduct
  - Disputes that cannot be resolved through discussion will be escalated to the maintainer

### Future Governance

As Orion gains collaborators, a more distributed or voting-based model may be introduced. This document will evolve with the community.
